    <h1>Account & Data Deletion – Your App Name</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Your App Name</strong> does not allow users to create an in-app account and does not store
        user login credentials within the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in some cases we may hold limited information that you have shared with us
        (for example, via email or support communication). You can request deletion of such
        data at any time.
