# 🗑️ Account & Data Deletion – TimeTravel Store

**TimeTravel Store**, developed by **Innovating Realm**, does not allow users to create in-app accounts and therefore does not store login credentials or user profiles within the app.

However, if you have shared any information with us outside the app (such as through email, support requests, or feedback forms), you may request deletion of that data at any time.
